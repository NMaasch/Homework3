# Homework3
CMPM 163

This is part of the homework includes using shaders on a particle system along with
a form of audio visualization.

In my attempt, I made a rising smoke/flame particle system with a shader that interpolates between colors based
on the age of the particle. I then added music to the scene and had the colors of the smoke change based on the audio.
